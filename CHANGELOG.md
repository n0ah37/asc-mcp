# Changelog

All notable changes to `appstore-mcp`. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added

- Optional `ASC_TOOL_DISCOVERY=1` mode exposes only `search_tools`,
  `get_tool_details`, and `call_discovered_tool`. Search and execution use the
  same `ASC_TOOLS` and `ASC_READ_ONLY` filters as the normal tool surface.
  The generic call is conservatively annotated as destructive when writes are
  enabled; inspect the target tool's annotations before approving writes.
- Repository contributor guidance in `AGENTS.md`.

### Security

- Updated locked `h2` and `rustls` versions to include fixes for
  RUSTSEC-2026-0258 and RUSTSEC-2026-0285.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-08-06

The two minor items left over from 0.3.0's profiling. Internal only — no tool,
parameter, or output change.

### Changed

- **The release binary is 25.8% smaller**: 8.15 MB → 6.05 MB, via whole-program
  LTO in a single codegen unit. It adds ~42 s to a full release build, which
  only runs in the release workflow and in parallel across the three platforms,
  while the binary ships three times over inside every `.mcpb`. Debug and test
  builds are unaffected.

  `panic = "abort"` would shrink it further and was deliberately not used: a
  panic in one tool handler would take the whole server down rather than failing
  that single call, and an MCP client on stdio would lose its session.

- **Deduplicating `included` resources across pages is no longer quadratic.**
  `merge_page` rebuilt its seen-set from every resource accumulated so far on
  each page, so a 20-page walk re-hashed the same resources nineteen times over.
  The set is now built once in `get_paged` and carried through. Identities are
  also one allocation instead of two. Worst case (20 pages × 200 sideloaded
  resources): **6.00 ms → 2.76 ms**.

### Added

- Tests that the seen-set survives across all pages rather than just the last,
  that `get_paged` deduplicates sideloaded resources over HTTP, and that a
  resource identity cannot confuse `("ab", "c")` with `("a", "bc")`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-06

Performance and resource use, driven by measurement rather than guesswork.
Profiling first ruled out the usual suspects: startup is ~5 ms, idle RSS is
7.5 MB, and generating 114 tool schemas doesn't register. The costs were
elsewhere.

### Changed

- **Tool results are serialized compactly.** Indented JSON measured **1.72×**
  the bytes of the same document — 72% more tokens for identical information,
  and a byte budget that carried ~40% less of the data actually asked for. A
  large `list_apps` page now delivers **421 items** within the 60 KB budget.
  This is visible in output: results are no longer pretty-printed.
- **Analytics segments stream.** The gzip decoder now feeds the CSV reader
  directly, and the download is handed on as `Bytes` instead of being copied
  into a `Vec`. A 1.2 MB segment expanding to 10.6 MB previously held **11.8 MB**
  of intermediates; peak is now the compressed buffer alone. Parsing 300k rows
  also got faster: **28 ms → 14.7 ms**.
- **Report parsing runs on a blocking thread.** Gunzipping and parsing is
  synchronous CPU work — ~15 ms for 300k rows and linear beyond that — and was
  stalling an async worker for the duration.
- **Response capping stopped rebuilding the document to measure it.** Sizes are
  now counted through a writer that allocates nothing, and the kept prefix of
  `data` is found in a single pass using the fact that compact JSON costs
  exactly one comma between items — replacing a binary search that cloned and
  re-serialized a candidate document on every probe. Rendering a 2000-item page:
  **8.59 ms → 4.00 ms**, against a 2.15 ms floor for serializing it once, and
  the multi-megabyte throwaway allocations are gone.
- **Upload chunks are reference-counted.** `Bytes` instead of `Vec<u8>` means
  handing a chunk to a retry attempt no longer copies it — previously even the
  first, successful attempt duplicated the whole chunk.

### Added

- `tests/packaging_metadata.rs` asserts what previously only failed at release
  time: the `server.json` description within the MCP Registry's 100-character
  limit, the crate version agreeing across all four packaging files, the
  release-asset URL, and a `CHANGELOG` entry for the current version.
- A test that the kept prefix is the *largest* one that fits, not merely one
  that fits, and a test that measured length always equals serialized length —
  the size arithmetic rests on that.

### Fixed

- The `server.json` description exceeded the MCP Registry's 100-character limit,
  which failed the v0.2.0 registry publish with a 422. Released artifacts were
  unaffected.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-06

Hardening and context control. No breaking changes to existing tool calls: every
tool keeps its name and parameters, and every new knob is opt-in or defaults to
the previous behaviour.

### Added

- **`download_analytics_segment`** (tool 114) closes the analytics loop. The
  other analytics tools navigate to a presigned segment URL; this one fetches it,
  gunzips it, and returns the rows as JSON keyed by column name, with a
  `max_rows` sample and the true row count. Handles both tab- and
  comma-separated segments, and quoted fields.
- **Tool annotations.** Every tool now advertises `readOnlyHint`,
  `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint`, so a client can tell
  `list_apps` from `remove_user` instead of treating every call alike. Effects
  are derived from each tool's leading verb, and a tool whose verb isn't
  recognised fails the test suite rather than shipping unlabelled.
- **`ASC_READ_ONLY`** serves only the 35 tools that cannot modify the account.
  `appstore_request` is kept but refuses any method other than `GET`, so the
  escape hatch can still reach uncovered endpoints without being a way around
  the restriction.
- **`ASC_TOOLS`** serves only the groups you name (or the `core` preset, 41
  tools), cutting the per-session context cost of tool definitions. An
  unrecognised group serves nothing and says so, rather than quietly falling
  back to everything.
- **`max_pages` on `appstore_list`** follows `links.next` and merges up to 20
  pages into one result, turning an N-turn cursor loop into one call.
  `meta.pagesFetched` and `meta.hasMore` report what happened.
- **Request timeouts** (`ASC_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `ASC_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
  `ASC_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT_SECS`). There were none before, so a stalled connection
  hung the tool call indefinitely with no way to cancel it over stdio.
- **Retries with backoff** (`ASC_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3). A `429` is replayed
  for any method since Apple rejected it without applying it; a `5xx` or
  mid-flight timeout is replayed only for idempotent methods — never a `POST`,
  which could otherwise create a duplicate resource. Honours `Retry-After`,
  bounded so a tool call can't stall for minutes.
- **Response shaping** (`ASC_COMPACT_RESPONSES`, `ASC_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`).
  Per-resource `self` links and link-only relationships are stripped — often
  most of a JSON:API page — and an oversized response sheds `included` and then
  trailing `data` items, carrying a `_truncated` key that says what went missing.
- Declared MSRV (1.88), verified by its own CI job, plus an advisory
  `cargo audit` job.

### Changed

- **Asset uploads stream from disk.** The file used to be read into memory whole
  and each chunk copied again; now the checksum is computed block by block and
  each operation reads only its own byte range, so peak memory is one chunk
  rather than the size of the asset. A chunk that fails is retried on its own
  instead of discarding the whole upload.
- **`appstore_request` validates the HTTP method** against the documented set.
  A typo like `FETCH` is a valid HTTP token, so it used to become a real request
  and come back as an opaque error.
- The crate is now a library plus a thin binary, so tests can drive a real server
  against a mock API.
- CI asserts the invariants of the tool surface — unique names, real
  descriptions, object schemas, correct annotations, and that the filtering knobs
  withhold exactly what they claim — instead of a hardcoded tool count that broke
  on every addition while proving little.

### Testing

96 → 202 tests. The new ones cover the HTTP layer that unit tests on body
builders can't reach: retry and no-retry decisions, timeouts, pagination and
merging, the three-step upload protocol (byte ranges, checksum, absent
`Authorization` header on presigned `PUT`s), segment download and parsing, and
the served tool surface under each configuration.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release: 113 tools across the App Store Connect API, plus two generic
JSON:API escape-hatch tools.
